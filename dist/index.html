            looking for a pet sitter and wants to have a kind and
            responsible person to care for their pets while they're
            away and be able to enjoy their time off without
            having to worry about their pets, as they would be in
            safe and very capable hands."</p>

          <p class="padding">"Sonia has taken care of my 9 year old Yorkie multiple
            times when I have gone on vacation and she has
            always taken such good care of him. She'll keep me
            updated as well as send me photos throughout the
            day. My dog enjoys his time with her and I feel at
            ease knowing he is being watched over by someone
            reliable!"</p>

          <p class="padding">"Sonia and Emmanuel were wonderful! They made us
            comfortable from the beginning. Gave us updates, photos,
            videos the entire time to ensure we stayed connected with
            Izzi. She came home happy, clearly well-cared for and we
            were just thrilled all around. We have more trips coming
            this summer and hope Sonia and Emmanuel will be
            available. Highly recommended!!"</p>

          <p class="padding">"Sonia and Emmanuel took very good care of our
            puppy. They were very prompt in sending photos
            throughout the day and was very flexible in
            accommodating a last minute change to our pickup
            schedule. I definitely recommend trusting your pup
            in their good hands. I plan to leave my puppy with
            them while on future trips."</p>

          <p class="padding">"They were great with my dog Indy! I got many
            updates during her stay and she came back to me
            very happy. I can tell they took good care of her, and
            I hope they can take care of her again the next time I
            need a sitter."</p>

          <p>"Manny and Sonia provided terrific care for Morris at their home in Bellevue for a very
            long stay.
            Communicative and eager to know all of Morris's habits, they shared pictures and updates regularly and
            helped facilitate both an introductory meet-and-greet, as well as a smooth drop-off and pick-up. They were
            also quick to share updates as their work-from-home schedule evolved. Thank you again, Manny and Sonia,
            for
            taking such good care of Morris!"</p>
